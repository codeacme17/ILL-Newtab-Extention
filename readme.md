# New tab for chrome extention

It's a chrome extention to create a new tab.

> Inspiration from window11 and macOS notice bar.

<!-- ## What we have ?

In the first release version, we only have 3 tools.
They are: - Weather - Calendar - Todo list.
But I really wish that more programmers can develop more tools and features to this extention.

### Weather Tool

It's a simple weather component, and the API is from https://www.qweather.com/ (Thanks for qweather provides that amazing and free apis).

### Calendar Tool

I made this tool by using the three-part react plugin called "react-calendar". -->
